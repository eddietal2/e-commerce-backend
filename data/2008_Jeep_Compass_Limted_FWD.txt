Performance & Driving Characteristics:

The 2008 Compass was noted for its car-like ride and handling, making it suitable for city driving and highway commutes.
The 2.4L engine, while adequate, was sometimes described as sluggish or "hum-drum" in terms of acceleration compared to competitors, particularly with the CVT.
Reviews mentioned noticeable wind and road noise, and a potentially harsh ride over bumps, contributing to less overall refinement than some rivals.
Its FWD setup made it primarily a road-going vehicle, not intended for serious off-road adventures, though it could handle light duty or slippery conditions (unlike 4WD versions with "Freedom Drive I" or "Freedom Drive II").
Model Year Updates (2008 specific):

Air conditioning became standard on all trims.
Chrome interior accents were added as standard.
A navigation system became a new option for the Limited trim.
Mild revisions were made to engines and transmissions for smoother, quieter operation.
Jeep introduced a limited lifetime powertrain warranty for the 2008 model year.
